        <img src="SiteMap.png" alt="SiteMapImage">

        <h3 id="features">System Features</h3>
        <ol>
            <li id="operator"><strong>Manage logistics (operator)</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Description: </strong>The operator manages orders' flow, introduces details of delivery (pick-up/drop-off address, client's personal information, generates AWB), sends notifications to clients via email and RSS and responds to clients' requests.</li>
                    <li><strong>Priority: </strong>This feature's implementation is of high priority, because it is essential for operators to easily use the Web application.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li id="client"><strong>See and modify delivery details (client)</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Description: </strong>The client is able to enter the AWB corresponding to their delivery and track its status in real-time. They can also modify details such as prefered delivery hour, contact the driver, cancel/postpone delivery and ask for a return if the package has issues.</li>
                    <li><strong>Priority: </strong>This feature has rather high priority, since the client's requests must be honoured as efficiently as possible.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li id="courier"><strong>View daily schedule (courier)</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Description: </strong>The courier has access to a list of deliveries that needs to be honoured in a day. He picks-up parcels from the deposit and is given the list of addresses where they are supposed to be dropped-off. Based on it, he figures the scales in the most efficient possible way.</li>
                    <li><strong>Priority: </strong>This feature also has high priority since the driver needs to be well-informed about all the important details in order to best manage the deliveries.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li id="administrator"><strong>Manage employees and view statistics (administrator)</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Description: </strong>The administrator has access to the database where all the employees (couriers and operators) are registred. He also has access to all the orders, where he can see weekly/monthly statistics about the company's deliveries in different areas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Priority: </strong>This feature is important at an organizational level, since the administrator must know who his employees are and be aware of the flow of deliveries.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="work">How we worked as a team</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We had a first meeting where each of us pointed out their vision about how the site should look, where we also started the ideas for the Scholarly HTML.</li>
            <li>We used Trello to organize ourselves better: <a href="https://trello.com/b/yNLarWJd/big-project">See here</a></li>
            <li>We decided together about a color theme and about what interfaces we were going to implement. </li>
            <li>We divided our tasks in the following way:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Alin:</strong> Started MainWindow from scratch (Set background, Navigation Bar and its Buttons), Client Interface, Administrator (Manage Employees) </li>
                    <li><strong>Andreea:</strong> Scholarly HTML (Write in HTML), Main Window (Services, About Us, FAQ, Footer, Login and SignUp buttons implementation), Courier Interface, Administrator Interface (Statistics)</li>
                    <li><strong>Rares:</strong> Created Logo and Background image in Photoshop, Operator Interface, Map (company's working area)</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
